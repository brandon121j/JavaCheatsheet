
Encapsulation: binding the data and functions that operate on that data into a single unit known as the class.

* To achieve encapsulation declare the classes variables as private and provide setter and getter methods to access and change the variables

- Example:

	public class Student {
		private String name;

	public String getName() {
		return name;
		}

	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
		}
	}

+ Why encapsulate?
- The encapsulate class is easy to test. So, it is better for unit testing.
- It is a way to achieve data hiding in Java because other class will not be able to access the data through the private data members.
- provides you the control over the data.
