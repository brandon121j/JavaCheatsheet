
+ What is Inheritence? The process that enables one class to acquire the properties of another

* To inherit from a class use the extends keyword

- Example:
	class Dog extends Animal {
		// some code
	}

* Note that Dog is the subClass and Animal is the superClass
* You can access the supperclass from the subclass using super keyword
