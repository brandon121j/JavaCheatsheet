
What is Polymorphism? uses methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

* Polymorphism is done using method overriding

- Example: 

    class Animal {
        public void animalSound() {
            System.out.println("The animal makes a sound");
        }
    }

    class Pig extends Animal {
        public void animalSound() {
            System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
        }
    }

    class Dog extends Animal {
        public void animalSound() {
            System.out.println("The dog says: bow wow");
        }
    }

* Note how each class that extends animal overrides the animalSound() method
