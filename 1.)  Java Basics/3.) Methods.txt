
+ What is a Java Method? Block of code that performs a certain task (aka a function in JS world)

+ Simple Method Syntax: returnType methodName() {}
- Example: int addNumbers() {}

+ Complete Method Syntax: accessModifier returnType methodName (parameterList) {}
- Example: public static int addNumbers(int a, int b) {}

+ Method Access Modifiers: restricts the scope of a method
- default: No keyword required
- private: Only accessible to the class it's in
- protected: Accessible within the same package or subclass
- public: Makes accessible to all classes

+ Method Non-Access Modifiers: provide information about their behavior
- final: cannot be overriden/modified
- static: belongs to class rather than an object
- abstract: body is provided by the subclass
- transient: attributes and methods are skilled when serializing the object containing them
- synchronized: methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time


+ No return type: To return no value in a method use the void keyword
- Syntax: void

+ Calling a Method: methodName();
- Example: myMethod(22);
